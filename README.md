# Projektarbete-Filmvisarna

The company Filmvisarna AB is a small cinema chain that wants to start competing locally with SF. They have a couple of movie theaters in Småstad and have secured the rights to show a number of different movie titles.

Now they need help building a first version of their website, where visitors should be able to:

Get information about movies being shown, incl. dates and times.
Watch the trailers for the films
Book your cinema tickets online - and find out the total price, locations (row and seat number) and booking number.
Filmvisarna AB would like to have a booking system where you can see a graphic sketch of the movie theaters and their seats. You should be able to book a number of adjacent seats for your company during a specific screening of a film. Initially, the best remaining seats should be marked, but the visitor should be able to change the choice.

While booking, you should be able to choose the number of visitors and see the total price. When you complete a booking, you should receive a unique booking number (which should not be easily guessed), and be able to see which row(s) and seats you have booked.

So far, you do not need to be able to pay online - without payment this happens when you arrive at the cinema and give your booking number to the staff.

Note! Pensioners and children (under 12) have a lower ticket price. Normal ticket price is SEK 140, for pensioners SEK 120 and for children SEK 80.

The lounge chairs are numbered from right to left, front to back. (The chair at the front right has the number 1. If the salon has 100 chairs, the one at the back left has the number 100.)

# Inspiration/competition comparison
Feel free to look at other cinema sites:

* Filmstaden - the big shit
* Less more “artsy” cinemas, e.g. Cinema in Lund
Feel free to check out some more commons in the team - discuss what is good and less good UX of the sites you look at.
